# Reactive-Web-Api

Reactive systems have certain characteristics that make them ideal for low-latency, high-throughput workloads.

One of the main reasons developers move from blocking to non-blocking code is efficiency. Reactive code does more work with fewer resources. With this framework I took advantage of multi-core, next-generation processorsâ€”handling potentially massive numbers of concurrent connections. With reactive processing, more concurrent users can be satisfied with fewer microservice instances.
